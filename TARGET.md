- Writing maintainable, testable, long-lived codebases

---

## Testing & Quality Engineering

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) where it makes sense
- Unit, feature, and end-to-end testing strategies
- Test isolation, database refresh patterns, mocking & fakes
- Preventing regressions in fast-moving teams
- Reviewing and enforcing code quality standards

---

## Cloud, DevOps & Scalability

---

## Data & Infrastructure

- Relational databases at scale (MySQL, OracleDB)
- Redis for caching, queues, and rate limiting
- Database migrations, rollbacks, and zero-downtime schema changes
- Backup strategies, recovery planning, and data safety practices

---

## Technical Leadership & Team Impact
